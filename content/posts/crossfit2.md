**Crossfit Open Finland 2020** analysed results.

With this study I wanted to understand the parameters influencing the Crossfit Open results. Results are taken from the official website [Leaderboard](https://games.crossfit.com/leaderboard/games/2020?division=1&sort=0), taking into account participants that reported their weight [kg] and height [cm], and did their workouts as RX without scaling. The total dataset consists of 383 men and 147 women (much fewer women reported their height and weight than men), whereas the total number of participants with the tag Finland was about 626 men and 610 women (some participants did not have any results).

</figure>

I compare participants ranking vs their height, weight and weigth index, as well as height and weight index to average values in Finnish population.

**As a result** can be seen that the average height is almost equal to average values among Finnish population. The weight index among the crossfit Open participants is on the other hand much lower to average value among Finnish population: -6% for men and -17% for women.

## Height of participants

In a comparison of height of the participants, it can be seen that among the participants the average height of men was 179.7 cm, whereas the height of women was 165.1 cm in average. The maximum height of men was 200cm and 180cm among women. The minimum height of men was 161cm and 148cm for women.

Interesting question is then, if these values are somehow different from those of an average citizen of Finland?

Therefore, the results indicate that neither taller or shorter people is participating to crossfit Open competition, but the height is almost equal to the average value among Finnish population.

Also the normalized height distributions are quite uniform in shape, indicating that there is no high peaks in any group of people with certain hight. For women, the dataset of 147 is a bit too small to make any conclusions on the distribution shape. Also a relevant question is why so many women did not report their height and weight at their leaderboard?

## Age of participants

One of the parameters reported by the crossfit Open participants was their age. Instead of comparing it to the average age among Finland, I wanted to see distribution of participants. This is shown in normalized histograms.

<figure class="float-left" style="width: 280px">
<img src="/media/men_age.png" alt=" height">
	<img src="/media/women_age.png" alt="Women height">
<figcaption>Age of men and women normalized.</figcaption>
</figure>

First of all, among men the average age is 36.4, where the youngest was only 16 years old, and the oldest participant 54 years old. Among women the average age is 33.1, where the youngest was 17 years old, and the oldest participant 51 years old. Note that these are only values among my dataset and is not representing the real range of people doing crossfit.

Surprisingly there is some jumps in the histogram columns. Most men tend to be in their mid-thirties, whereas for women there as drop in participants of early-thirties. In general, most of the participants are in their thirties, which might be indication for instance from the high partipant fees at crossfit boxes. This is just a speculation: maybe women are on a maternity leave in their early-thirties and they come back at their end-thirties where there is another peak in number of participants. For men the histogram distribution is much more uniform and doesn't show such radical changes as for women. Of course, the conclusions depend highly on the data visualization.

## Weight index of participants

Next was evaluated the weight index of participants that was calculated from the reported data. The average weight index values are 27.7 kg/m2 for men and 27.5 kg/m2 for women [(Terveyden ja hyvinvoinninlaitos)](https://thl.fi/fi/tutkimus-ja-kehittaminen/tutkimukset-ja-hankkeet/kansallinen-lihavuusohjelma-20122015/lihavuus-lukuina/lihavuuden-yleisyys-suomessa)

Among the crossfit Open participants in Finland, the average weight index was 26 for men and 22.8 for women. These values are much lower to average value among Finnish population: -6% for men and -17% for women. Among participants the minimum weight index was 19 and the maximum value for men was 42 and 30 for women.


## Comparison of Open events

Now has been look for average value of participants. I was wondering if there was differences among Open events. In total there was five events with different requirements: some requiring much more power capacities, some requiring "more lungs" meaning that the lactate threshold should be better. The lactate threshold is the maximal effort or intensity that normally an athlete can maintain for an extended period of time with little or no increase in lactate in the blood. This allows an athlete to continue doing physical exercises longer at higher intensity. When the intensity increases and the lactate is being released too quickly for the body to convert it we hit our lactate threshold. This is the stage where your muscles are burning or aching, and your performance will decrease quickly or more cause you to stop the activity to recover [(Lactate threshold)](https://crossfiticehouse.com/lactate-threshold/)

</figure>

I acknowledge that the plot is almost impossible to read, but still I could make some conclusions that are listed here:
* First of all, the number of participants "giving up" is increasing after each event, as the last column of the histograms is increasing. As you can see at the 5th histogram plot showing the rank at 5th event, there is a peak for participants that have a ranking which equals to the last place. This peak is much smaller for women.
* Where for men, the ranking is quite uniform for all levels, for women there is much more good participants recorded than worse ones.
* If we look at the last row of both multi-plots, there can be seen the relation between participant's weight to success at each event. For men it shows that the ranking is almost similar in each, although especially at event 4 and also a little bit at event 5 the heavier participants did better than in events 1-3. At womens side the results are not that clear, but it seems that heavier participants did better at events 2 and 5.

All in all, I wish every participant had a great time at the Crossfit Open. Next I wish to compare same parameters at the level of world's best.

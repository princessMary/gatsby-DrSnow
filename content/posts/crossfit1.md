## OPEN 20.2

AMRAP in 20 minutes\
4 Dumbbell Thrusters (2x50/35 lb)\
6 Toes-to-Bar\
24 Double-Unders

This workout begins with the dumbbells on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may begin performing thrusters. After 4 reps of thrusters are completed, the athlete will advance to a pull-up bar to perform toes-to-bars. After 6 reps of toes-to-bars are completed, the athlete will move to a jump rope and complete 24 double-unders before returning to the thrusters for the next round.

The athlete’s score will be the total number of repetitions completed before the 20-minute time cap. There is no tiebreaker for this workout.
